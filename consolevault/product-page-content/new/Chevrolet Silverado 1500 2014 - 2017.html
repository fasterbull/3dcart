    Console Vault has recently made the greatest design improvement since the product was first developed. Our new Triple Guard Lock System incorporates a latch design similar to the pins used in the doors of bank vaults, an overall improvement that greatly increases security.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    The design also includes a front channel that incorporates the lid into the body of the vault itself, ultimately eliminating stress from the physical lock. The end result: the most secure product Console Vault has ever made.
