The Hummer H2 Console Vault is actually the very first Console Vault product ever created and has since remained one of the most popular devices within our lineup. The unique design of the Hummer H2 Console Vault provides maximum efficiency for storage and the profile itself provides an elegant appearance. The Hummer H2 Console Vault includes a small interior shelf, perfect for storing an extra handgun clip or other small and essential items. The lid is spring-loaded and will remain in the open position when unlocked.

    Console Vault has recently made the greatest design improvement since the product was first developed. Our new Triple Guard Lock System incorporates a latch design similar to the pins used in the doors of bank vaults, an overall improvement that greatly increases security.

    The design also includes a front channel that incorporates the lid into the body of the vault itself, ultimately eliminating stress from the physical lock. The end result: the most secure product Console Vault has ever made.
