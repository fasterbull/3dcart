As Ford Expedition owners know, their truck features one of the largest consoles within the industry. Console Vault has created a vault that takes full advantage of the Expedition's ample storage space, and despite the vault's large size, installation still takes the same 5 - 10 minutes. The Ford Expedition Console Vault is incredibly popular with government officials and officers and represents one of our landmark offerings.

    Console Vault has recently made the greatest design improvement since the product was first developed. Our new Triple Guard Lock System incorporates a latch design similar to the pins used in the doors of bank vaults, an overall improvement that greatly increases security.

    The design also includes a front channel that incorporates the lid into the body of the vault itself, ultimately eliminating stress from the physical lock. The end result: the most secure product Console Vault has ever made.
