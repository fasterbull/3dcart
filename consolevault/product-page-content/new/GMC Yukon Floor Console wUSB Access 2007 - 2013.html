The GMC Yukon Floor Console is Console Vault's flagship product. Taking full advantage of General Motors' model change in 2007 that allowed a much larger console, Console Vault crafted an amazing vault that took full advantage of the ample space now provided.

The GMC Yukon Floor Console Vault features an awesome secret compartment at its base, providing an extra dosage of security and covertness for your valuables. The hidden compartment may be used for extra secure storage, and should you not wish to take advantage of this feature, simply remove the access panel for additional space. We've seen some customers attach a holster to this area with velcro, enabling them to keep their firearm in place while traveling.

    Console Vault has recently made the greatest design improvement since the product was first developed. Our new Triple Guard Lock System incorporates a latch design similar to the pins used in the doors of bank vaults, an overall improvement that greatly increases security.
  </div>
  <div><br /></div>
  <div>
    The design also includes a front channel that incorporates the lid into the body of the vault itself, ultimately eliminating stress from the physical lock. The end result: the most secure product Console Vault has ever made.
